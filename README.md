To test the functionality of this script, there are multiple ways to run it. Here, I'll share 2 methods. Enjoy :)

Preparation:
Make sure you've copied the file to your desktop.

Running the Script (via Terminal):

OPTION 1:
Compile the TypeScript file:
tsc filename.ts

Run the compiled JavaScript file:
node filename.js

OPTION 2:
Install TypeScript and ts-node locally:
npm install ts-node typescript --save-dev

Run the TypeScript file directly:
npx ts-node filename.ts
